## Part I

I was able to classify four groups from the set of 25 ammonites. My conclusions are based on visual observations of the fossils, with the factor of the ridges/rings along the shell, and how deep they appeared. The presence of porous holes along the shell was also a factor. 

+ Group A (Many ridges, quite superficial): 1, 2, 6, 15, 18, 19, 21, 24
+ Group B (smooth, no ridges): 3, 4, 7, 9, 13, 14, 16, 17, 23, 25
+ Group C (deep and frequent ridges): 8, 11, 20
+ Group D (Porous; small holes along the surface): 12, 22

I used the data set to explore the mean values for the measurements of diameter (D), the ratio of umbilical width to the diameter (U/D) and the ratio of shell width to diameter (W/D) for Groups A-D. 

````R
	Group A	Group B	Group C	Group D 
Mean D	32.975	38.2	62.16667	34.45
Mean U/D	0.3825	0.347	0.4433333	0.38
Mean W/D	0.2675	0.238	0.2366667	0.26
Mean Strat 	6.7125	5.45	10.2	4.55
````


From the data, we can see that a possible trend in the data is that the mean U/D corresponds to mean stratigraphic position (the larger the mean U/D, the larger mean Stratigraphic position). This is a hypothesis for the data, with no evidence of it being true. Thus, we can use statistical analysis by comparing both groups. 

1) Your identifications (how many species do you recognize in the group, and which specimens belong to which species). Explain how and why you came to this conclusion.

There are 4 species identified, with 8 specimens belonging to species A, 10 specimens belonging to species B, 3 species belonging to species C and 2 species belonging to species D. My conclusions are based on visual observations of the fossils, with the factor of the ridges/rings along the shell, and how deep they appeared. The presence of porous holes along the shell was also a factor. This is further grounded by statistical analysis that compares the mean U/D to the mean stratigraphic position. 

2) The morphological features you used to distinguish each species, including whatever combination of qualitative or quantitative traits you think are important.

Ridges/rings along a shell in terms of depth, presence of pores on the shell, mean U/D and its relation to mean stratigraphic position. 

3) The nature of ontogenetic change, if any, in the species. Explain your reasoning.

An instance of ontogenetic change could be that the mean U/D decreased as the stratigraphic position decreased.

> Stratigraphic position in this case likely records periods of time (hundreds or thousands of years) well in excess of a generational time-scale.

4) The possibility of sexual dimorphism as a cause of morphological differences and how you evaluated that possibility.

Sexual dimorphism could be a cause for morphological differences due to size—specimens with a larger diameter could be female (larger to house the egg), while those with a smaller diameter could be male. This was a difficult task, for there is no threshold for sexual dimorphism in terms of diameter to help differentiate males and females. Without the aid of visible differences between images, the only thing that could be done was looking at the mean of the 12 smallest diameters and the 12 largest diameters. After this comparison, there was not a deducible way to evaluate sexual dimorphism. 

> You want to look at size differences *within* your species categories, not among all specimens. -0.5 points.
 

## Part IIa

1) “land”		“links”		“species”	“site”		“outline”
> Show the code next time.



2) They are lists. 

3) It is a 3 dimensional array

## Part IIb

1) “land”

2) <strike>Procrustes was completed on landmark data.</strike>
> You needed to show the code! -1 points

3) <strike>PCA done on hummingbird data.</strike>
> You needed to show the code! -1 points

4) The graph is not extremely clear, with points in all 4 quadrants, condensed in the center. I would say that there is either 4 species or simply 1 species. 

## Part III

1) Fangs longer than 6 inches. 

2) Sulfurous odor. 

3) Adorable lashes. 

4) C, D and E. 

5) The characteristic of a laser death ray. 

6) Synapomorphy. 

7) 
+ Family One: monophyletic
+ Family Two: polyphyletic
+ Family Three: paraphyletic. 

8) No, this is not advisable. This is because species A is shown to not have the characteristics of a sulfurous odor and fangs longer than 6 inches, which are traits of the common ancestor for species D and E. Additionally, D and E do not have the characteristics that A is noted to have, which are adorable lashes and a fluffy tail. Due to the dissimilarities between the three groups, it would not be wise to group them together. 

9)
+ Group 1: <strike>Polyphyletic</strike> paraphyletic
+ Group 2: Monophyletic
+ Group 3: Paraphyletic. 

> You are missing the other two groups? -0.75 points

> Peramorphosis for *G. mccullochi* and paedomorphosis for *G. gigantea*., - 0.25 points

2)Gryphaea mccullochi. 

> *G. gigantea*, and you di dnot explain your reasoning. - 0.5 points
