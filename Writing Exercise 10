“Origination, Extinction and Mass Depletions of Marine Diversity” by Richard K. Bamach, Andrew H. Knoll, Steve C. Wang (2004) 

> 9/10

## Article Summary 
The article aims investigate and present the specific patterns of extinction and origination that has led to the conclusion that only three of the “big five” mass extinction were distinct events. Specifically, the Ordovician, Permian and Cretaceous are all periods that qualify as global mass extinctions each with their own unique patterns of extinctions and diversity dynamics. Interestingly, the mass depletions of diversity have no common effect between the “big three” making common causation seem unlikely. 
By utilizing stage or sub-stage interval during the Early Ordovician Arenig, the loss of biodiversity is measured with 13.5% acting as the minimum. The study found that only five of the intervals suffered a loss greater than 13.5% of the number of marine genera that entered the interval. These constitute the “big five” and are better regarded as mass depletions in diversity. While the late Frasnian and end-Triassic periods had depletions due to reduced origination, the two Cambrian intervals had a similar marked loss in diversity due to reduced origination. The article concluded by noting that diversity in the Ordovician, end-Permian and end-Cretaceous interval resulted exclusively from elevated extinction. Thus, they can be considered “true” global mass extinctions because the extinction magnitudes of these three intervals are statistically different from the extinction magnitudes in their stratigraphic neighborhoods. 

## Positive Feedback 
Overall, I thought that this article was well presented and strong. Complicated ideas were broken down into points that were easy to follow and addressed the topics at hand, such as distinguishing key objectives of the study in the beginning as well as clearly outlining the conclusions at the end. The figures were extremely helpful in understanding the data. 
Specifically, I found figure nine to be exceptionally well-done. The rates of genus diversity and genus turnover are plotted for easy comparison and indicate a high degree of taxonomic turnover. With analogous timelines (both spatially and literally), graph B shows the proportions of origination and extinction in the same time periods of Cambrian through Early Ordovician. This allows for directly comparing the trends of biodiversity, extinction and origination. The content and presentation of figure nine was well-thought out, and an overall  strength to this article. 

## Constructive Feedback 
Although it was extremely helpful for background knowledge on defining the criteria for a mass extinction event, I thought that the article could have focused more on the methods and analytical methods of the study. The first few pages were helpful, but was very heavy in providing information on based on different cited literature. This would have been best pursued through headings that clearly denote the traditional sections found in a research paper. 

> That's a fair criticism, but is more stylistic than scientific.

## Evaluation of Graphs and Figures 
	This article features numerous figures that contribute to the overall understanding of the findings. First, figure one shows the diversity and diversity turnover of marine genera by interval through the Phanerzoic. The five major post-Cambrian diversity depletions are highlighted, with a peaked dotted line representing the genus turnover within each interval. The magnitudes of the peaks compared with the minimum standing diversity at interval boundaries represent the degree of faunal turnover in the intervals. 
	The second figure is a graph that compares the proportion of change in the gain or loss of genus diversity with respect to time. The five major diversity depletions are numbered, and the timeline spans from the Caradoc to the Plio-Pleistocene. The graph shows that intervals with greater than 13.5% of diversity increase are common only after major diversity depletions. 
	Figure three consists of two graphs, both of which show the proportions of genus extinction arranged in rank order by magnitude. Graph A compares the proportion of genus extinction with rank order from low to high intensity. In this graph, all 107 intervals of the Phanerzoic are included. Graph B plots the same type of data, but limits to the Middle Ordovician to Plio-Pleistocene values only. 
	Figure four is composed of three graphs, with the focus of mapping genus extinction by interval in stratigraphic time order. Figure A maps the proportion of extinction of genera with time in millions of years ago. The proportion of genus extinction is shown, with the Cambrian of Early Ordovician concentration of high proportions highlighted. The second map, B, graphs the ln proportion of extinction of genera against time (millions of years ago). The third map, C, compares the proportion of extinction of genera with respect to the three time intervals of Cambrian, Early Ordovician and mid and late Ordovician. The graph shows the proportion of genus extinction of trilobites and non-trilobites. 
	The first table in the paper organizes the data on proportions of origination and extinction for the major intervals of the Phanerzoic based on the general magnitude of extinction. The overall number counts, minimum proportions, mean proportions, maximum proportions and omitted proportions are well organized in a table to better understand the breakdowns in data for each interval.
	Figure five is composed of two graphs showing the statistical analysis of post-Arenig extinction magnitudes. Graph A shows the nonlinear lowess regression with 11% bandwidth, revealing long-term fluctuation in extinction intensities. Graph B is a histogram of residuals from non-linear lowess regression with intervals having intensities comprising a statistically significant node. Moreover, figure six graphs the proportion of genera with respect to time in millions of years ago. It shows the proportions of both genus orgination and extinction through the Phanerozoic. The intervals of diversity loss are circled, with the “big five” mass depletions numbered. 
	Table two shows the actual diversity changes during the “big five” diversity depletions and the changes that would have occurred if origination or extinction in each interval had been the mean for the larger segment of time, to which each is assigned in Table 1. I found this table one of the most helpful when understanding the data, as it breaks down the different models causing the diversity loss and compares it to the actual data. The diversity changes for the exclusively elevated extinction and low origination plus extinction are broken down in respective intervals. 
	Figure seven is comprised of three graphs, showing the relationship between origination and extinction for the three mass diversity depletions that are true mass extinctions. The three separate graphs show the differences between all various intervals of diversity loss. Additionally, figure eight shows the relationship between origination and extinction for the two mass diversity depletions that are not exclusively extinction driven. The two graphs aim to split up intervals to better see trends in amongst the proportion of genera. 
	Figure nine is composed of two graphs. Graph A compares the number of genera against time (mya). Genus diversity and diversity turnover through the Cambrian and Early Ordovician, showing a high degree of taxonomic turnover. Graph B shows the proportions of origination and extinction through the Cambrian and Early Ordovician. Both origination and extinction were generally high during these time frames, with the two intervals of marked diversity depletion distinguished by depression of origination, not peaks of extinction.
