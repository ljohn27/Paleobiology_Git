Problem Set I 
1. West
2. plot(ModernMap,col=rgb(1,0,0,0.33),lty=0.01,add=TRUE)

The line of code is describing the following commands: 

Everything within the plot function notes what will be mapped-- in this case, the ModernMap (so the map of modern continents from zero mya). 

col=rgb(1,0,0,0.33) is a function calling for colors corresponding to their given intensities; in this case, it is the red, green and blue primary colors. Their respective intensities are deonted by the numbers ranging from 0 to 1. The first number 1 is the intensity of red, 0 for green and 0 for blue. 0.33 denotes the alpha value, which specifies a transparency value.  

lty=0.01 corresponds to a function that interrupts the drawing of lines. In this case, the line will be interrupted every 0.01 places along the cooridnate system. 

The add=TRUE means is a command that tells the program to show/graph the data that corresponds/matches to the inputted information within the plot function.
