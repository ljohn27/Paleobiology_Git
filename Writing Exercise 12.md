“The Red Queen and Court Jester: Species Diversity and the Role of Biotic and Abiotic Factors Through Time” by Michael  J. Benton (2009)

> 9/10

## Summary 
	This week’s article compares and contrasts how evolution is shaped by different types of factors: biotic (as in the Red Queen model), abiotic (as in the Court Jester model) or a combination of both. The two models operate on different geographic and temporal scales. Specifically, the Red Queen model is applied to competition, predation and other biotic factors that shape ecosystems locally and overs short time spans. It focuses on the balance of biotic pressures. On the other hand, the Court Jester model includes extrinsic factors such as climate and oceanographic tectonic events that affect patterns at a regional and global scale over longer time spans of thousands and millions of years. In terms of diversity, paleobiological studies show that species diversity is largely propelled by abiotic factors such as climate, landscape or food supply. 
	The author explores global and taxic investigations of how particular studies correspond to the predictions of the Red Queen, Court Jester and multilevel mixed models. Additionally, comparative phylogenetic methods are utilized to shed light on clade dynamics of the macroevolution of species diversity, such as clade dynamics, species richness and the origin of novelties. It is ultimately concluded that a close examination of evolution, biotic interactions drive ecosystems while biodiversity is driven by abiotic interactions with the physical environment. 
## Positive Feedback
	Overall, I thought that this article was well presented. Complicated ideas were broken down into points that were easy to follow through the unique tables and figures. I felt that the figures were the strongest piece to the article. Specifically, I found figure three to be refreshing and well-done. Both parts A and B of the figure had visual models of depicting the phylogenetic relationships and the morphospace occupation for Triassic archosaurs that were out of the ordinary. Instead of expected line graphs or tables, the data was plotted in ways that utilized different illustrative mapping methods, such as a phylogenetic tree and coordinate system.

## Constructive Feedback
	The methods in this article are rather <strike>quantitative</strike> qualitative in nature, meaning that the results are not presented as quantifiable. Various relationships are described between the conclusions drawn from the study, yet there isn’t a standardized format comparing all three models of interest. A reference of presenting such data numerically would strengthen the conclusions of the piece undoubtedly. However, it is understood that limitations of the study prevent such a presentation to take place.

## Evaluation of Graphs & Figures 
There are a number of graphs and figures in this paper that help with the understanding of the material presented in this paper. The first figure shows two graphs. Both of these graphs show the operation of biotic causation (Red Queen) and abiotic causation (Court Jester) models of different geographic and temporal scales. Graph A shows geographical scale (from locality to the entire continent) vs. temporal scale (Milankovitch scale, species life span and genus life span). The Red Queen may prevail at organismic and species level on short time scales, while the Court Jester holds its own on larger scales. This graph suggests that no controlling effect of the physical environment on evolution. In fact, physical-environmental disruptions may elicit biotic responses along the red line that separates the outcomes between the two. Graph B maps the environmental scale vs. temporal scale (the same as mentioned above). The microevolutionary Red Queen is compared to the macroevolutionary Red Queen that posits constant extinction risk, which is a view that has been largely rejected. 
Figure two is a line graph showing the patterns of marine animal genus diversification through the Phanerozoic. The two lines compare current estimates from the empirical and uncorrected Sepkoski database and the corrected, standardized analysis of the Paleobiology Database. This graph shows time against the number of genera comparing the empirical and corrected in different colors. The number of corrected genera is overall much higher than the empirical, except for when the lines match at 0 ma. 
Table one shows the macroevolutionary phenomena and their support for either the Red Queen (biotic, intrinsic) or Court Jester (physical, extrinsic) models. The table is split into three columns, one for the Red Queen, Court Jester and the last one labelled as “Multilevel Mixed.” This is created to fit either worldview, so the category caters to both. 
Figure three displays the phylogenetic relationships and morphospace occupation for Triassic archosaurs. Is has two components—a phylogenetic tree that is mapped against time as well as an intricate coordinate map showing the morphospaces spatially. Figure A shows the observed durations of major lineages. Figure B shows the empirical morphospace for Late Triassic archosaurs based on the first two principal coordinates.
