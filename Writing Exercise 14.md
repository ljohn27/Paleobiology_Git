“Has the Earth’s Sixth Mass Extinction Already Arrived?” By Anthony D. Barnosky, Micholas Matzke, et al.

## Summary 
	This article presents the possibility of a sixth mass extinction that may be under way due to known species losses over the past few centuries and millennia. For the purpose of the study, a conservative approach to assessing the seriousness of the ongoing extinction crisis is embraced by setting a high bar for recognizing mass extinction—the extreme biodiversity loss characterized by the “Big Five.” This is determined as when over 75% of species disappear within a geologically short interval for when extinction rates accelerate relative to origination rates. 

	This study measures extinction through rate and magnitude. The extinctions per million species-years (E/MSY) is utilized as a measure to capture the extinction over time. Throughout the piece, various methods are explored as to deal with the gaps and bias in the fossil record from both the fossil record and modern species. Critically engaged in the methods process, this article aims to shed light on various approaches to tackle the large task of approximating a mass extinction event. 

The article concludes with multiple future directions, including the need to standardize various formats of analysis such as rate comparisons adjusted for measurements over disparate timescales, magnitude comparisons in the same species for modern and fossil organisms as well as taxonomic and geographic comparisons that have equal fossilization material. There are two concluding points to the article concerning the possibility of the next mass extinction—that existing data does not qualify as a mass extinction when aligned to the magnitude of the Big Five, and that losing species now in the “critically endangered” category would propel the world to a state of mass extinction. 

## Positive Feedback 
	This article was refreshing in its presentation of methods. Since it had a goal of comparing various approaches to measure mass extinctions in both the fossil record and modern species, there was a great deal of weighing options rather than providing concrete conclusions. I found it helpful that various methods were presented with their pros and cons. The task of approximating the next mass extinction is a lofty one, with many challenges, which was clearly conveyed in the article. I thought that the article did a good job of acknowledging gaps and bias in data, such as through the box outlining the “severe data comparison problems.” However, the authors did well in minimizing these flaws by looking at general trends or through standardization. For example, the gap in paleontology databases between one million and 50,000 years is mitigated by viewing consistent trends in the data over various time intervals. 

## Constructive Feedback 
	As crucial figures to the study, I thought that Figure One and Three could have been presented through a series of figures instead of just one. There is a lot going on in just one graph, as various trends and relationships are captured. It is overwhelming to digest all of this information in one shot, especially when it is accompanied by a caption that is nearly a page in length. I personally do not think that the compilation of all of this information betters my understanding of the information that is presented. Instead, breaking down the figure into multiple images would also effectively segment the caption and facilitate a greater understanding of the material by the reader. 

## Evaluation of Figures & Graphs  
	The first table characterizes each of the recognized mass extinction events in history, known as the “Big Five.” Each event is named, given a range for when it occurred (in millions and thousands of years), alongside the approximate percentages of genera and species loss. Another column is devoted to describing the proposed causes of each extinction. The proposed causes are qualitative, and sometimes are isolated to general regions, such as Siberian Volcanism in the Permian event or activity in the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province in the Triassic event. 
	There is a following table comparing the methods used to characterize present and past extinctions. The table has a total of three columns, one for a general method that describes the type of analysis that took place (such as what was assessed for the means of comparison). The next column describes variations and representative studies that were used, while the last column provides multiple references to applications to the corresponding method. 
	Figure one is a graph that depicts the relationship between extinction rates and the time interval over which the rates were calculated for mammals. The extinction rate is represented by E/MSY, calculated from taxon durations from lists of extant, recently extinct and Pleistocene species. These data points are compiled from the Paleobiology Database and literature applying to 100,000 year-and-less time bins, as shown by gray points. The large colored dots represent the calculated extinctions since 2010; Red for the end-Pleistocene extinction event, orange for averaged documented historical extinctions, and blue for attempts to enhance comparability of modern to fossil data. The brown triangles represent the projections of rates that would result if “threatened” mammals go extinct within 100, 500, or 1,000 years. The yellow shading encompasses the non-anthropogenic range of variance in the extinction rate that would be expected given different measurement intervals. The fading of the yellow to the right indicates that the upper boundary of such variance becomes uncertain at short time intervals. 
	Figure two is also a graph that compares the extinction magnitudes of IUCN-assessed taxa to the 75% mass-extinction benchmark. The number of species known or assessed for each of the groups listed is Mammalia, Aves, Reptilia, Amphibia, Actinopterygii, Scleractinia, Gastropoda, Bivalvia, Cycadopsida, Coniferopsida, Chondrichthyes and Decapoda. The numbers next to each icon indicate the percentage of species in terms of extinction magnitude. Asterisks besides these numbers indicate taxa for which very few species (less than 3% for bivalves and gastropods) have been assessed. The colors of the icons code for various characteristics of the species that are analyzed—white icons indicate species “extinct” and “extinct in the wild” over the past 500 years; black icons add currently “threatened” species to those already “extinct” or “extinct in the wild”; yellow icons indicate the Big Five species losses. Additionally, the white arrows show where extinction percentages are probably inflated, as species perceived to be in peril are often assessed first. 
	Figure three is a graph that depicts extinction rate versus extinction magnitude in relation to time. This figure is separated by large vertical lines that illustrate the range of mass extinction rates that would produce the Big Five extinction magnitudes, which is bracketed by the best available data from the geological record. Additionally, there are two sets of colored dots. The larger, free-standing dots indicate what the extinction would have been if the extinction had hypothetically happened over 500 years. The dots connected by lines indicate the rate as computed for the past 500 years for invertebrates, classified by three colors: light yellow for species already extinct, dark yellow for the hypothetical extinction of “critically endangered” species, and orange for the hypothetical extinction of all “threatened” species. This graph provides estimations for when the sixth mass extinction would take place given that the rate of extinction would remain constant to 75% species loss. Separate time intervals are hypothesized for “threatened” and “critically endangered” species.
