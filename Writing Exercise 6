“How good was the fossil record? Clues from the Californian Pleistocene” by James W. Valentine (1989) 

## Article Summary 

The article presented The Paleontological Society aims to prod at the validity of the fossil record by looking at the Californian Pleistocene record. Specifically, the numbers of genera from Bivalvia and Gastropoda that are recorded in the fossil record are used as the subjects of analysis in the study. The article aims to point out the gaps in fossil record abundance and data based on various reasons for loss, which include erosion, burial and destruction of skeletons in situ. As it ends, the article aims to conclude that the vast majority of marine invertebrate fossil record does not represent a series of unprecedented skeletal accumulations. Instead, it is articulated that the preserved remnants of an orginal record are formed through typical episodic processes that are normally expected. 

## Positive Feedback 

Overall, I thought that this article was informative, despite tackling a broad topic. I thought that it was wise to select two groups for analysis in the fossil record. This allowed for a narrow focus that was comparative in nature without being overwhelming in presentation (which is very possible given the expansive nature of the fossil record and paleobiology database). 

## Constructive Feedback 

I found that the article was lacking in the number of supporting figures to enhance its presentation of data. Though the appendix and data tables provided a great deal of insight, in terms of the breakdown of numbers belonging to each genera, graphs could have been used to plot the data in a way that would reinforce comparative grounds. For example, if there was a line graph showing the different datasets for Gastropoda and Bivalvia, there would have been a greater understanding in how both compare when evaluating the legitimacy of the fossil record. 


## Evaluation of Graphs and Figures 
	
Figure 1 is a map of the principle localities mentioned in the text. It provides a visual of the different locations numerically in the form of a map for easy identification. Table 1 is a summary of the living pool of molluscan species from the Californian region. There are rows allocated for the family, genera and species of Bivalvia and Gastropoda, with an additional row summing both categories based on the classification level. The columns account for the number of living, known fossil and percent of known fossil available.  This table is concise and easy to interpret. The last page of the article includes an appendix that displays the pool of living Californian shelf species and its fossil representation. Each row consists of the families within Bivalvia and Gastropoda that are studied. In the columns, the number of living species, known fossil, living genera and known fossil are listed out. This provides a complete picture of the data that is well-presented and efficient in format, overall.
