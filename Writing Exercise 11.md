“The Effect of Geographic Range on Extinction Risk During Background and Mass Extinction” by Jonathan L. Payne and Seth Finnegan (2007) 

## Article Summary 
The strength of the effect of geographic range as a buffer for taxa against extinction is the topic of interest in this paper. There is focus to uncover extinction selectivity regimes during “background” intervals, as opposed to major mass extinctions, alongside differentiating between background and mass extinction. Logistic regression is utilized to evaluate the selectivity of genus survivorship with respect to geographic range. An odds ratio is constructed to measure the relationship between the odds of an outcome and odds of survival. A global database of fossil benthic marine invertebrates are studied, spanning an interval of 500 million years as it stretches from the Cambrian to Neogene periods. 
The results of the study indicate that wide geographic range has been significantly and positively associated with survivorship throughout the Phanerzoic. Even after controlling for differences in species richness and abundance among genera, the significant association between geographic range and survivorship remains. The study asserts that widespread environmental disturbances can explain a weakened association between geographic range and extinction risk by affecting genera that have similar ecological and physiological traits on global scales. Overall, geographic range is concluded as the most consistent significant predictor of extinction risk in the marine fossil record. 

> You missed discussion of a very important result, that geographic range size is less related to extinction during mass extinctions.

## Positive Feedback 
A strength of this study was using logistic regression rather than standard linear regression when evaluating the association between geographic range and extinction rate. By having a binary outcome rather than a continuous one, the odds ratio is able to be constructed. The odds ratio serves as an understandable point of interpretation, for its congruity to the slope in standard linear regression allows for its statistical significance to be easily evaluated. This allows for the data to reveal its patterns and eventual conclusions in a manner that is easier to understand. 

## Constructive Feedback 
I think that a weakness of this paper is restricting the <strike>population size</strike> study to benthic marine invertebrate fossil occurrences. I think that analyzing vertebrate species as well would provide insight on a relatively more recent analysis on the strength of geographic dispersion. If invertebrate and vertebrate fossil occurrences were analyzed separately, a holistic conclusion could be drawn from patterns seen in the fossil record amongst all benthic marine fossil occurrences. However, I understand that analyzing the vertebrates could even be another paper in and of itself. 

## Evaluation of Graphs and Figures 
	This article features numerous figures that contribute to the overall understanding of the findings. Figure 1 is composed of two graphs that map out selectivity in log-odds against age in millions of years ago. Specifically, the Phanerzoic trends in the geographic range selectivity of genus survivorship is graphed. Graph A shows the selectivity estimated from a single logistic regression of geographic range and survivorship. Graph B shows the geographic range selectivity from multiple logistic regression of geographic range, species richness and occurrence frequency versus survivorship. Both graphs show that selectivity is least pronounced at times of major extinctions events, but generally indicates a positive and significant association between geographic range versus survivorship. 
	Table 1 presents the correlations between geographic range selectivity and change in metrics of record quality. Here, the results are presented for comparisons of interval-to-interval changes in record quality (first differences) versus log-odds. Different graphing and statistical measures such as N, slope, R-squared and p-value are provided for each factor. The only significant p-value (at alpha equaling 0.05) was for tectonic plates in PBDB. 
	Figure 2 plots extinction intensity (as a proportion of genera) vs. geographic range selectivity (in log odds). The following time boundaries are plotted: Mesozoic-Cenozoic, Post-Ordovician Paleozoic and Cambrian-Ordovician. Extinction intensity is generally high in the Cambrian-Ordovician and low in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. The trend follows the idea that selectivity exhibits a weak inverse association with extinction intensity. 
	Last, Figure 3 graphs the expected geographic range selectivity vs. the observed geographic range selectivity, as measured in log-odds with the idea that extinctions were entirely independent across plates. For intervals with less-than-expected geographic range selectivity, they are disproportionately intervals associated with geological evidence for widespread environmental disturbance.
