 “The Influence of Lithification on Cenozoic Marine Biodiversity Trends” by Austin J. W. Hendy (2009)

> Your discussion of the figures was thorough and had a lot of information. I would consider moving some of those points up to your summary.
> As it currently stands, your summary doens't sufficiently convey any of the following important points.

+ Why was Hendy interested in comparing lithified and unlithified sediments?
+ How did he test this hypothesis?
+ Where did his data come from? How did he collect it? Was it all the same?
+ What other confounding variables did he look at (e.g., shell mineralogy and body size) 

## Summary 
Presented by The Paleontological Society, the article looks at the influence of increased availability of unlithified fossiliferous sediments in strata that could have influenced the increased diversity of genera within the benthic marine communities from the Paleozoic to Cenozoic periods. With a focus on the Cenozoic fossil record of New Zealand, the data concludes that unlithified sediments increase the amount of fossil material and observed diversity in the designated time periods. Additionally, it preserves a pool of taxa that is compositionally distinct from lithified sediments. The article concludes by noting that the influence of lithification to the increased amount of diversity is unsurprising. In fact, it was uncovered that there are fundamental differences in the composition and abundance structure from assemblages when comparing lithified and unlithified sediments. Ultimately, this deconstructs the common belief held about sediments in the scheme of lithified and unlithified and sources a possible link to bias in the fossil record. 
	
## Positive Feedback 
I thought that the method employed for the samples and preparation was notable in this article. With a relatively high number of samples of 200-300 specimens per collection, there was an adequate amount of samples that contributed to making statistically significant results. I found it helpful that the author addressed the concern of comparing it to other studies that have more elaborate methodologies that focus on retrieving maximum diversities. By highlighting this point, their argument for their own approach of making comparisons at equivalent sample sizes between lithified and unlithified assemblages was further strengthened and convincing to the reader. 

## Negative Feedback 
I felt that the tables were difficult to follow. Both tables one and two showcased a great amount of data that was packed into a small amount of space. Although the captions were very informative, I felt that the information could have been split up in various tables for data that were related or showed a pattern. For example, the mean values for lithified and unlithified could have been in its own table that would allow for a better comparison between the two values. This would break up the data, and make the table easier to read. 
	
## Tables & Figures 
The first figure has two graphs—Graph A shows the variation in global Phanerozoic marine invertebrate biodiversity graphed with the within-community diversity from open marine environments superimposed. The global diversity is measured by genera, while within-community diversity is measured by species. Overall, this is mapped by time on the x-axis. The second figure, graph B, is a variation in proportion of collections derived from unlithified and non-lithified (unlithified and poorly lithified combined) sediments through the Phanerzoic. The y-axis describes the percentage of collections while the x-axis presents time.
Figure two depicts the effect of lithification on an occurrence-based data set. Graph A shows the variations in mean richness (in genera) and the mean degree of lithification of collections from late Miocene-Pleistocene sediments. Graph B shows the mean and maximum of genus richness for collections assigned to lithification categories. The mean is cross hatched with the genus richness.
Table one shows the genus richness in lithified, poorly lithified and unlithified sediments of the late Neogene New Zealand, sourced from the Fossil Record File and from field-collected bulk samples. The data is organized based on subset, in which the mean, max, all, Pleistocene, Late Pliocene, Early Pliocene and Late Miocene for showing mean genus richness, which is unstandardized and rarified to 100 specimens. 
Figure three shows the rareification of census counts from bulk samples of varying lithification from the late Miocene-Pleistocene sediments of the Wanganui Basin, New Zealand. Graph A shows the number of specimens vs. genera for the rareification curves for individual samples coded by lithification category (unlithified vs. lithified). Graph B shows specimens vs. genera through the means of individual curves in A within each lithification categories shaded with 95% confidence intervals. 
igure four shows the rarification of census counts from bulk sampled dominated by Tawera of varying lithification from the late Miocene-Pleistocene sediments of Wanganui Basin, New Zealand. Graph A displays specimens vs. genera showing the rareification curves for individuals samples coded by lithification category. Graph B depicts the relationship of specimens vs. genera by the means of individual curves in A within each lithification categories with shaded 95% confidence intervals. 
Figure five shows the influence of lithification on taphonomic features of skeletal assemblages. Graph A shows the lithification grade (unlithified, poorly lithified and lithified) for Aragonite and Calcite based on the percentage of genera in skeletal types. Graph B shows the relative composition of various sized classes (small, medium and large) as a percentage of genera. Error bars indicate 95% of confidence intervals. 
Table two shows the comparison of mean sample-level diversity estimates among faunal lists and samples derived from lithified and unlithified matrix of the late Narogene of New Zealand. An “increase factor” is computed as a ratio of the mean unlithified to lithified diversity. All of the data is presented in a table format with a sample size of 100, unless specified as 200 in parentheses. 
The last three pages of the article is comprised of an appendix that lists the molluscan and brachiopod genera, and abundance data that is pooled across all samples included in this study. The following are depicted in the table: Polyplacophora, calcite, mixed calcite and aragonite, mixed aragonite and calcite, unlithified, lithified and aragonite. The number of lithified and unlithified samples are totaled, and are also presented as a mean percentage.
